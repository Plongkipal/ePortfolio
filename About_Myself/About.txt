As a computer scientist, I’ve built my background on a mix of theory and hands-on experience, focusing on creating practical solutions to complex problems. 
I’m skilled in programming languages like Python, Java, and C++, and I enjoy tackling challenges in areas like algorithms, data structures, and system design. 
What excites me most is exploring emerging fields like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cybersecurity, where there’s always something new to learn and innovate. 
I’m passionate about developing technology that’s not just efficient and scalable but also responsible and impactful. 
Beyond the technical side, I value collaboration and continuous learning, which helps me grow and adapt in this ever-evolving field.
