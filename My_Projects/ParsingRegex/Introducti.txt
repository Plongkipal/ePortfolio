Automation project, the program parses regular expressions into an abstract syntax tree (AST) using a parsing algorithm like recursive descent. The AST is then converted into a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) to process input strings. The NFA matches strings by exploring multiple paths simultaneously, ensuring efficient and accurate pattern recognition.
